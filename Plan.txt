1. Learn how the Github Pages run
2. Learn how to bind the domain name to the Github Pages
3. Fix the problem that user from China Mainland cannot visit the Github Pages


Some knowledge should be known before:
1. How to buy a domain name
2. How to resolve a domain name 
For the question above, check the answer on Tencent Yun Website.




Should I first know how to built website OR how to use Github Page?

Let me check Tecent CLoud first..............................It seems like I just need to learn GP(reffer to Github Pages).

Add ouououoc.com in setting/pages        [checked]  [reffer:https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/302/12648]
Learn the GB document		[]



Now we rewind/reconsider the process which confused me a lot, how to describe the fuzzy difficulties?:

1. How we map our own domain name to the GP?
: In the GP settings? it seems there're 2 setting webpage:
  1. https://github.com/settings/pages
  2. https://github.com/toughtok/toughtok.github.io/settings/pages
  So, what's the difference between the two webpage?

2. DNS resolves in Tencent Cloud, why [记录类型]A is conflict with [记录类型]CNAME ? Even though I succeed in setting [记录类型]A with th IP(185.199.108.153), I don't know why. The domain name was suddenly accessed inexplicably/bafflingly. What's the substantial changes in my operation?

3. About the https://?
